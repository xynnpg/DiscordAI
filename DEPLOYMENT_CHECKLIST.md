## Troubleshooting Guide

### Health Check Fails
**Symptoms**: Health endpoint returns error or doesn't respond

**Solutions**:
1. Check that all environment variables are set
2. Verify your Discord bot token is valid
3. Check Railway logs for error messages
4. Ensure your bot has proper permissions in Discord

### Discord Bot Doesn't Connect
**Symptoms**: Bot appears offline or doesn't respond to commands

**Solutions**:
1. Verify the bot token is correct
2. Check that the bot is invited to your server
3. Ensure the bot has proper permissions
4. Review Railway logs for connection errors

### Web Interface Doesn't Work
**Symptoms**: Website doesn't load or shows errors

**Solutions**:
1. Check that Flask is starting properly
2. Verify the `/health` endpoint is accessible
3. Check Railway logs for Flask errors
4. Ensure all environment variables are set

### Database Issues
**Symptoms**: Database connection errors or missing data

**Solutions**:
1. Wait for PostgreSQL to fully provision
2. Verify `DATABASE_URL` is properly set
3. Check for database connection errors in logs
4. Restart deployment if database is stuck

## Testing Checklist

### Web Interface Testing
- **Homepage Loads**: Visit your Railway URL
- **Add Model**: Can add new AI models
- **Edit Model**: Can modify existing models
- **Toggle Models**: Can enable/disable models
- **Delete Models**: Can remove unused models

### Discord Bot Testing
- **Basic Response**: `/ping` command works
- **Model Selection**: `/change` command with autocomplete
- **Model List**: `/models` shows available models
- **AI Chat**: `/ask` command works with selected model

### Database Testing
- **Model Persistence**: Models saved through web interface
- **User Preferences**: User model selections are saved
- **Data Integrity**: No data corruption or loss

## Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Symptoms | Solution |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Service unavailable** | Website returns 503 error | Check Flask app startup in logs |
| **Bot not responding** | Bot offline or silent | Verify Discord token and permissions |
| **Database errors** | Connection or data issues | Wait for PostgreSQL provisioning |
| **Environment missing** | App crashes on startup | Add required variables in Railway |
| **Model not found** | `/change` shows no options | Add models via web interface |
| **AI not responding** | `/ask` fails | Check OpenRouter API key and model status |

## Security Checklist

### Environment Security
- No sensitive data in code repository
- Strong, unique secrets for `FLASK_SECRET_KEY`
- Discord bot token is secure
- API keys are properly managed

### Access Control
- Bot has minimum required permissions
- Web interface is properly secured
- Database access is restricted
- HTTPS is enabled (automatic on Railway)

## Performance Monitoring

### Resource Usage
- Monitor CPU usage in Railway dashboard
- Check memory consumption
- Track network bandwidth
- Set up alerts for resource limits

### Application Health
- Regular health check monitoring
- Log analysis for errors
- Response time monitoring
- Error rate tracking

## Post-Deployment Verification

After successful deployment, verify:

### Core Functionality
- **Health Endpoint**: `/health` responds correctly
- **Web Interface**: Accessible and functional
- **Discord Bot**: Responds to commands
- **Model Management**: Can add/edit models
- **AI Chat**: `/ask` works with models

### Security & Performance
- **Environment Variables**: All required variables set
