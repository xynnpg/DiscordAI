# ðŸ§  Memory Features Documentation

This document describes the conversation memory functionality added to the Discord AI Bot.

## Overview

The Discord AI Bot now includes sophisticated conversation memory that allows the AI to remember previous conversations with each user, providing more contextual and coherent responses.

## Key Features

### ðŸ”’ Per-User Memory
- Each user has their own completely separate conversation history
- No data sharing between users
- Complete privacy isolation

### ðŸ’¾ Persistent Memory
- Conversations are stored in the database
- Memory persists across bot restarts
- Survives server downtime

### ðŸŽ¯ Context-Aware Responses
- AI remembers up to 10 previous message exchanges
- Responses are more relevant and contextual
- Follow-up questions work naturally

### ðŸ›  User Control
- Users can view their memory statistics
- Users can clear their memory at any time
- Complete control over personal data

## New Discord Commands

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `/ask <content>` | Ask AI with conversation context (enhanced) | `/ask What did we discuss earlier?` |
| `/memory_info` | View your conversation memory statistics | `/memory_info` |
| `/clear_memory` | Clear your conversation history | `/clear_memory` |

## Command Details

### `/ask` (Enhanced)
- **What's New**: Now includes conversation context from previous messages
- **Context**: Remembers last 10 message exchanges (20 messages total)
- **Behavior**: AI can reference previous conversations naturally
- **Example Flow**:
  ```
  User: "Hi, I'm learning Python"
  AI: "Great! Python is an excellent language to learn..."
  
  User: "What should I learn first?" (later)
  AI: "Since you're learning Python, I'd recommend starting with..."
  ```

### `/memory_info`
- **Purpose**: View statistics about your conversation history
- **Information Shown**:
  - Total messages exchanged
  - Number of your messages vs AI responses
  - Preview of recent conversations
- **Privacy**: Only shows your own data
- **Example Output**:
  ```
  ðŸ§  Your Conversation Memory
  
  ðŸ“Š Statistics
  â€¢ Total messages: 24
  â€¢ Your messages: 12
  â€¢ AI responses: 12
  
  ðŸ’¬ Recent Messages
  ðŸ‘¤ What's the weather like?
  ðŸ¤– I don't have access to real-time weather data...
  ðŸ‘¤ Can you help me with Python?
  ```

### `/clear_memory`
- **Purpose**: Reset your conversation history
- **Effect**: Removes all stored conversations for your user
- **Confirmation**: Shows how many messages were cleared
- **Use Cases**:
  - Starting fresh conversations
  - Privacy cleanup
  - Switching topics completely

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

#### ConversationHistory Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE conversation_history (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    role VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,  -- 'user' or 'assistant'
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    model_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_user_created ON conversation_history (user_id, created_at);
```

### Memory Management

#### Context Window
- **Size**: 10 message exchanges (20 total messages)
- **Ordering**: Chronological (oldest first)
- **Format**: Standard OpenAI chat completion format

#### Storage Strategy
- Messages stored immediately after sending/receiving
- Automatic cleanup not implemented (manual via `/clear_memory`)
- Index on `user_id` and `created_at` for fast retrieval

### API Integration

#### Enhanced OpenRouter Client
```python
def generate_response(self, model: str, message: str, 
                     system_prompt: str = "You are a helpful AI assistant.", 
                     conversation_history: Optional[List[Dict[str, str]]] = None) -> Optional[str]:
```

- **New Parameter**: `conversation_history` - List of previous messages
- **Format**: `[{"role": "user", "content": "..."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."}]`
- **Integration**: Seamlessly includes context in API calls

## Privacy & Security

### Data Isolation
- âœ… Each user's conversations are completely separate
- âœ… No cross-user data access
- âœ… User-controlled data deletion

### Data Storage
- âœ… Stored locally in your database
- âœ… No external data sharing
- âœ… Standard database security practices

### User Rights
- âœ… View personal conversation statistics
- âœ… Delete personal conversation history
- âœ… Complete control over memory functionality

## Performance

### Optimizations
- **Database Indexing**: Fast queries via `idx_user_created` index
- **Limited Context**: Only last 10 exchanges to manage API costs
- **Efficient Retrieval**: Single query with LIMIT clause

### Benchmarks
Based on testing with 100 messages:
- **Message Storage**: ~0.007 seconds per message
- **History Retrieval**: ~0.003 seconds for 20 messages
- **Context Generation**: ~0.001 seconds for 10 messages

## Setup & Migration

### Automatic Setup
Memory functionality is automatically set up when you start the bot:

```bash
python run.py
```

### Manual Setup
If you need to manually set up the memory system:

```bash
# Update database schema
python update_memory_database.py

# Verify setup
python setup_memory.py

# Run tests
python test_memory.py
```

### Database Migration
The `ConversationHistory` table is created automatically via SQLAlchemy's `db.create_all()`.

## Usage Examples

### Contextual Conversations

**Example 1: Learning Session**
```
User: /ask I'm learning web development
AI: That's great! Web development is a valuable skill...

User: /ask What should I focus on first?
AI: Since you're learning web development, I'd recommend starting with HTML and CSS fundamentals...

User: /ask How long does that usually take?
AI: For the HTML and CSS fundamentals we discussed, most beginners need about 2-4 weeks...
```

**Example 2: Problem Solving**
```
User: /ask I'm having trouble with a Python function
AI: I'd be happy to help with your Python function! Could you share the code or describe the issue?

User: /ask It's supposed to calculate the average but returns wrong values
AI: Let me help debug your average calculation function. Can you show me the code?

User: /ask Here's the code: def avg(nums): return sum(nums) / len(nums) + 1
AI: I found the issue! You have an extra "+ 1" at the end of your average function...
```

### Memory Management

**Viewing Memory Statistics**
```
User: /memory_info

Response:

```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Memory Not Working
**Symptoms**: AI doesn't remember previous conversations
**Solutions**:
1. Check if `ConversationHistory` table exists: `python test_memory.py`
2. Verify database migrations: `python update_memory_database.py`
3. Restart the bot: `python run.py`

#### Performance Issues
**Symptoms**: Slow response times with memory enabled
**Solutions**:
1. Clear old conversations: `/clear_memory`
2. Check database indexes: Review `conversation_history` table
3. Consider reducing context window in code (currently 10 exchanges)

#### Memory Info Command Fails
**Symptoms**: `/memory_info` returns errors
**Solutions**:
1. Verify database connection
2. Run: `python setup_memory.py`
3. Check bot logs for specific errors

### Database Issues

#### Missing Table
```bash
# Create missing tables
python update_memory_database.py
```

#### Corrupted Data
```bash
# Test and repair
python test_memory.py

# Clear all memory (if needed)
# Connect to database and run: DELETE FROM conversation_history;
```

## Development

### Testing
```bash
# Run all memory tests
python test_memory.py

# Test specific functionality
python setup_memory.py
```

### Adding Features
The memory system is designed to be extensible:

- **Custom Context Windows**: Modify `limit` parameter in `get_conversation_context()`
- **Message Filtering**: Add filters in `ConversationHistory` model methods
- **Export Features**: Add methods to export conversation history
- **Analytics**: Add aggregate queries for usage statistics

### Database Queries
Common queries for development:

```sql
-- Get user's message count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM conversation_history WHERE user_id = 'user123';

-- Get conversation statistics
SELECT 
    user_id,
    COUNT(*) as total_messages,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN role = 'user' THEN 1 END) as user_messages,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN role = 'assistant' THEN 1 END) as ai_messages
FROM conversation_history 
GROUP BY user_id;

-- Clear old conversations (older than 30 days)
DELETE FROM conversation_history 
WHERE created_at < datetime('now', '-30 days');
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Export Conversations**: Allow users to download their conversation history
