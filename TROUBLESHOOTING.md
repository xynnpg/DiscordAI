# Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: Discord Bot Can't Access Models from Web Interface

### Symptoms
- Web interface shows models (like "Uncensored" and "Darius")
- Discord `/change` command shows "No options match your search"
- `/models` command shows "No active models available"

### Root Cause
The Discord bot and web interface are not properly sharing the same database or there's a timing issue with database initialization.

## Solutions

### 1. Check Database Connection
Run the debug command in Discord:
```discord
/debug_db
```

This will show:
- Total models in database
- Active models count
- Details of all models

### 2. Test Models Command
Run this command to see what models are available:
```discord
/test_models
```

### 3. Check Railway Logs
Look for these error messages in Railway logs:
- Database connection errors
- Flask app startup issues
- Discord bot connection problems

### 4. Verify Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in Railway:
- `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`
- `GUILD_ID`
- `UI_PASSWORD` (for web interface access)
- `DATABASE_URL` (should be auto-provided by Railway)

**Railway Template Variables:**
- `GUILD_ID` - Your Discord server ID
- `UI_PASSWORD` - Password for web interface management  
- `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` - Your Discord bot token

### 5. Database Migration Issues
If the database is empty or corrupted:

1. **Access the web interface** at your Railway URL
2. **Add your models again** through the web interface
3. **Make sure models are set to "Active"**
4. **Test with `/debug_db` command**

## Common Fixes

### If Models Exist But Bot Can't See Them
1. Restart the Railway deployment
2. Wait 2-3 minutes for full startup
3. Try `/debug_db` to verify database connection

### If Database Is Empty
1. Go to your Railway URL
2. Add your AI models through the web interface
3. Make sure to set them as "Active"
4. Test with `/models` command

### If Autocomplete Doesn't Work
1. Try typing the exact model name
2. Use `/models` to see available options
3. Check Railway logs for errors

## Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Check Bot Status
```discord
/ping
```
**Expected**: "Pong! 🏓"

### Step 2: Check Database Connection
```discord
/debug_db
```
**Expected**: Shows model count and details

### Step 3: Check Available Models
```discord
/models
```
**Expected**: Lists available models

### Step 4: Test Model Switching
```discord
/change [exact-model-name]
```
**Expected**: Confirms model change

## Expected Behavior

**After fixing, you should see:**
- `/debug_db` shows your models with "Active: True"
- `/models` shows your available models
- `/change` autocomplete shows your model names
- `/ask` works with your selected model

## If Still Not Working

### 1. Check Railway Logs
Look for specific error messages:
- Database connection failures
- Flask startup errors
- Discord bot connection issues

### 2. Verify OpenRouter API Key
- Check if your API key is valid
- Ensure the key has proper permissions
- Test the key with a simple API call

### 3. Ensure Models Are Active
- Go to web interface
- Check that models are marked as "Active"
- Verify model names match exactly

### 4. Restart Railway Deployment
- Restart the entire deployment
- Wait 3-5 minutes for full startup
- Test all commands again

## Quick Test

1. Go to your Railway URL
2. Add a test model with your OpenRouter API key
3. Make sure it's set to "Active"
4. In Discord, run `/debug_db`
5. You should see your test model listed

**If `/debug_db` shows 0 models**, the issue is with database initialization or the web interface isn't properly saving models.

## Common Error Messages

| Error Message | Possible Cause | Solution |
|---------------|----------------|----------|
| "No options match your search" | Models not in database | Add models via web interface |
| "No active models available" | All models disabled | Enable models in web interface |
| "Database connection failed" | Database not ready | Wait for PostgreSQL provisioning |
| "Bot not responding" | Discord token issue | Check bot token and permissions |
| "Web interface not loading" | Flask startup error | Check Railway logs for errors |

## Advanced Debugging

### Database Inspection
If you have database access:
```sql
SELECT * FROM models WHERE active = 1;
```

### Log Analysis
Check Railway logs for:
- Connection strings
- Flask startup messages
- Discord bot events
- Database queries

### Network Testing
Test connectivity:
- Web interface accessibility
- Database connection
- Discord API connection

## Getting Additional Help

If the issue persists:

1. **Check [DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md](DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md)** for setup issues
2. **Review [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)** for configuration problems
3. **Examine Railway logs** for specific error messages
4. **Test locally** to isolate the issue
5. **Visit Tutorial**: Use the [Discord AI Setup Guide](https://xynnpg.github.io/DiscordAI/) for visual instructions
6. **Seek community support** with specific error details

## Prevention Tips

### Best Practices
- Always test locally before deploying
- Use strong, unique environment variables
- Monitor Railway logs regularly
- Keep models organized in web interface
- Regular database backups (if possible)

### Monitoring
- Check health endpoint regularly
- Monitor Discord bot status
- Track model usage and performance
- Set up alerts for critical errors
